> September update: After a short but intense job hunt, I'm happy to say I'll be starting

> Thanks to all who [shared and read this post](https://twitter.com/jeffowler/status/890057552796450816), it was a vast help to me.

After 9 years in New York, I am leaving for good on August 1st, when I'll be
moving to Copenhagen with my wife and cat.

I came here with what were in retrospect some pretty vague ideas about what I
wanted to do, and I did some of that, and I did a bunch of other things I could
have never predicted. One of those things was "become a computer programmer,"
the decision to do so I maintain to be one of the most personally positively
impactful ones I have ever made and likely ever will make in my life. I have
limitless thanks for the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/),
[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) and the many colleagues at both who helped to
make that transition not only possible but also totally joyful.

I'll be looking for engineering work in the coming weeks and months. I'm hoping
to find a job somewhere that is...

- small enough for me to have a big impact on but big enough to offer a measure
of stability<sup>1</sup>

...and that is...

- working on something familiar enough for me have an immediate impact at a
  senior level but also on something that I could learn a lot from.

I am open to working remotely if it's the right situation, but I think I would
probably be happier, more productive, and benefit more from working IRL in
Copenhagen right now.

At Etsy I primarily worked as a product engineer on [Etsy
Manufacturing](https://www.etsy.com/manufacturing), a matchmaking service
intended to connect makers with manufacturers who have the tools and knowledge
to help them scale up their businesses in a sustainable and transparent way.
[Here's a New York Times
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/etsy-welcomes-manufacturers-to-artisanal-fold.html)
that was written about it when we initially launched.

While there, I split pretty evenly between the front and back ends. Sometimes I
describe this as "full stack" but I always add airquotes and equivocate on what
exactly I mean by that, since it's kind of a loaded and yet weirdly inspecific
term. I also had many opportunities to be exposed to a lot of other tools and
stacks and types of work, from data analytics and A/B testing to infrastructure
and operations.  Ask me about any of those things!

You can find many examples of my personal projects, communication and pedagogical styles, and
thought process on this blog. I think my favorites right now are [The Mandelwat
Set](/the-mandelwat-set/), which was republished in
[DailyJS](https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-mandelwat-set-c3037204bf83), the [Sild
series](/sild-is-a-lisp-dialect/), for which I wrote about 80,000 words on implementing an
interpreted lisp from scratch, and [How React Do?](/how-react-do/), which is my
attempt to figure out React from something resembling first-ish principles.

[Here's my resume](/jeff_fowler_resume.pdf). Please note that I've included
many hyperlinks in the PDF.

I like to work on interesting products that people use, and I love to both
learn and teach. If you know anyone in Copenhagen who I should talk to, [please
let me know](mailto:jeffowler@gmail.com)! I'll also be at the [Polymer
Summit](https://summit.polymer-project.org/) on August 22-23 and available to
talk then.

<sup>1</sup> _As a former full time musician, my idea of "stability" is
probably way, way less stable than yours for most values of_ `$you`. _What I really
mean here is "Can reasonably be expected to offer 2-3 years of some amount of
job security."_
