Well, Mara, they're mine, from a series I did last year futzing with old
polaroids. If I had the inclination I would say "distressing expired
filmstock."

That was last year around this time, or a little later, in a burst of
uncharacteristically fretless output, that I'd like to get to more often, pun
intended and I mean both ways this is a poorly written sentence.

Mostly I pressed the chemicals around in there using a wacom stylus and a flat
edge on a salt shaker. I've always been rotten at drawing, but this was mostly
abstract enough for me to do it.Â I really loved the effect so I made about 60
of them, although the vast majority are, shall we say, aesthetically inferior
*ahemcrapahem*... but enough turned out to make it worth the time.

There is also something rattling around in my brain about being open to
inspiration from unconventional media, like when my microwave hums a closed
position major seventh chord, which is really weird cause it only does that
when I put vegetarian gyoza in there... go figure...

I finished a nine panel one that the title bar is taken from first:

And then made I think 5 or 6 to mail to some folks, but I don't remember who
got what, so maybe let me know in the comments.

Also, best of luck with your own V-I, we're all in this together.
