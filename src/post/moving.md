A few weeks ago I visited some old friends in DC. I splurged a little and took
the train- it was too expensive; I waited too long to buy the tickets, but it
was also totally worth it.

I used to take the mega/bolt/fungwah bus to DC pretty frequently, or to
Philadelphia, or Baltimore, wait did I ever go to Baltimore? Maybe not; I went
to Boston though, to do stupid event photography gigs for a now defunct [weird
event company](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sheckys-new-york-4), I think the owner
fled the country; they still owe me 150 dollars.

Anyway here I was, taking the train, like an _adult_ or something. And we came
back into the station, _the_ station, Penn Station, and I'm walking through the
stink (I always say it's like crawling into the city through its own asshole)
and I'm waiting on my train, the C train, the _oldest, shittiest line_ in
the whole system, the cars being mostly from the 1950's and thus dramatically
older than I am, corporeally speaking, and the A trains are going by first one
and then three A trains and then _five_? How can there be a 5:1 ratio?

And the _entire time_ I am waiting for this rickety local train, the better
part of an hour, there are these two rats on the tracks, and they are just
really _fighting_ each other, really going after it, you know? Like some real
feral lord of the rats type biting, and tackling... and I thought, is there a
better metaphor for New York City? Than two rats, fighting in the muck on the
subway tracks, forever and ever?

Anyway, I'm moving to Denmark. My wife is Danish, and we're having a baby, and
so I'm moving. I'll be looking for work in technology in Copenhagen. I want a
place small enough that I can have a big impact on it, but big enough to offer
some measure of stability<sup>1</sup>. I'm going to buy a nice bike on my first
day, and when I bike around the city nobody is going to try to run me off the
road like they do in Brooklyn.

<sup>1</sup> As a former professional musician, my idea of "stability" is
probably way, way less stable than yours for most values of $you. What I
really mean here is "Can be expected to offer 2-3 years of not super tumultuous
work security"
